# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

> Welcome to the world of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
An ongoing curated list of frameworks, books, articles, talks, screencasts, recordings, libraries, learning tutorials and resources about test-driven-development.


*[Test Driven Development (TDD)](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) is a programming practice that instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed.

There are two levels of TDD:
- *Acceptance TDD (ATDD)* - With ATDD you write a single acceptance test, or behavioral specification depending on your preferred terminology, and then just enough production functionality/code to fulfill that test. The goal of ATDD is to specify detailed, executable requirements for your solution on a just in time (JIT) basis. ATDD is also called Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

- *Developer TDD* - With developer TDD you write a single developer test, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a unit test, and then just enough production code to fulfill that test. The goal of developer TDD is to specify a detailed, executable design for your solution on a JIT basis. Developer TDD is often simply called TDD.
