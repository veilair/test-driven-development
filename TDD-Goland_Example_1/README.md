# Test-Driven Development by Example in Go

This repo is an adaptation of the Multy-Currency Money example, from the book **Test-Driven Development by Example** by Kent Beck, to the Go programming language.

The idea is to separate the implementation by commits, following as close as possible the work described in the book, with some exceptions were applicable. 

Specially, I'm not planning to commit broken code. 

I'm also taking a few larger steps when the book takes it too slow.

## How to run the examples

I'm using the standard testing framework that's built in the Go language, so you just need to run `go test`.

For a more complete output you may use `go test -v -cover`.

## The TODO file

The [TODO.md](TODO.md) file represents the TODO list that evolves chapter by chapter.
